# Project Overview

This project aims to develop a web application for experimenting with digital signatures. The application will be built using Python and the Flask framework. All web page content will be in Korean.

## Key Features:
*   An overview of digital signatures.
*   Detailed explanations and interactive experimentation screens for RSA digital signatures.
*   Detailed explanations and interactive experimentation screens for ElGamal digital signatures.
*   A screen to calculate addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and inverse with modulo.
*   A screen to randomly generate a prime number and a primitive root.
*   Information regarding digital signature standards.
*   Additional content related to digital signatures.

The user interface will include a left-side menu for easy navigation between different pages.

# Building and Running

**TODO:** Specific build and run commands are not yet defined. Please refer to the project's source code for instructions once available. Typically, a Flask application can be run using `python app.py` or `flask run` after installing dependencies (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

# Development Conventions

No specific development conventions (e.g., coding style, testing practices) have been identified yet. Please adhere to standard Python and Flask best practices.

# Additional Notes

Input values on the experiment and calculation screens should be preserved when a button is pressed and also when navigating between pages.
When keys are generated, the public and private keys should be automatically entered into the relevant input boxes on the signing and verification forms.
